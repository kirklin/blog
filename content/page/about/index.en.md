<b>I've always aspired to be more than just a code-writing programmer. To me, programming is an art of creation, a medium for expressing ideas, and a tool for changing the world. My pursuit is to perfectly integrate technology, design, and humanities to create products that are not only powerful but also aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.</b>

<b>My quest for beautiful interfaces and ultimate user experiences stems from an innate desire for beauty and perfection. Whenever I design an interface, I ponder: How can each element be just right? How can I make users feel joy and satisfaction when using it? This pursuit reflects my understanding and interpretation of the world.</b>

<b>However, my vision is not limited to the technological realm. I firmly believe in the power of interdisciplinary thinking. Economics, psychology, philosophy, even art and literature - these disciplines seemingly unrelated to programming all hold important positions in my thinking model. This cross-disciplinary thinking allows me to avoid the "if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail" trap, enabling me to solve problems with a more comprehensive and in-depth perspective.</b>

<b>Photography and humanities are important ways for me to express creativity and understand the world. Through the lens, I capture fleeting moments of beauty in life; through reading and reflection, I gain a deeper understanding of human nature and society. These experiences enrich my perspective, allowing me to incorporate more humanistic care and aesthetic considerations when creating digital products.</b>

<b>I've always believed that truly great technology should be invisible, naturally integrating into people's lives to improve quality of life, rather than becoming a burden. That's why I'm constantly thinking about how to change the world. For me, changing the world isn't an empty slogan, but concrete action. Every carefully designed interface, every smooth user experience, every function that solves real problems - these are all my attempts to change the world.</b>

<b>My obsession with details and pursuit of perfection might sometimes be seen as stubborn. But I firmly believe that it's this near-obsessive focus that creates truly outstanding products. As I often say: "Perfection is a process, not an endpoint. When you feel satisfied, that's when you stop progressing." Innovation is crucial. But for me, innovation isn't just about learning new programming languages or frameworks. True innovation is about breaking boundaries, combining technology with design and humanistic thinking to create products that can truly improve people's lives.</b>

<b>Where does my motivation come from? It comes from seeing users' lives improve because of the products I design, from the sense of achievement when solving real problems through technology, and from the firm belief in creating a better world.</b>

<b>Some might say my ideas are too idealistic, that changing the world sounds somewhat arrogant and naive. But I've always believed that it's this seemingly impractical idealism that is the real driving force behind technological and social progress. "Idealists see opportunities in despair and create light in darkness. We don't just live in the world, we create it." If we don't work with the ambition to change the world, how can we create truly great works?</b>

<b>This is who I am, Kirk Lin, an engineer who always strives to inject artistic soul and humanistic care into code. I believe that through relentless effort, continuous innovation, and interdisciplinary thinking, we will eventually create products that are not only powerful but also beautiful, user-friendly, and truly capable of changing the world. This is not just my work, but my mission and passion. In this process, I will always remember: the pursuit of perfection is endless, and creating a better world is both our responsibility and opportunity.</b>
