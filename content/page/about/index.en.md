Hello, I'm Kirk Lin, a self-taught full-stack web developer and freelance software engineer from China. I am driven by the pursuit of innovation and the desire to bring ideas to life with elegant and functional interfaces. I am always striving to create the best user experience, architecture, and code quality in every project I undertake.

My passion for web development is matched only by my enthusiasm for open-source technology. As an avid contributor to open-source projects, I've gained valuable insights and knowledge from the wider community, and I'm always eager to share my own expertise to help others.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the world with my camera, capturing life's moments and reflecting on the beauty of the world around us. I am also an avid reader of philosophy, which allows me to contemplate the deeper meaning of life and the human experience.

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me, and I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with like-minded individuals and bring truly exceptional ideas to life.
